# Swedish

## Plurals, definite forms

Lmao good luck learning those, there are barely any rules. There are 2 grammatical genders (neutrum (ett), utrum (en)), and 5 different declensions. If you can find a pattern, immediately contact the Swedish embassy and say you have solved swedish grammar.

These are 5 different declensions of nouns:

|A bottle|Bottles|The bottle|The bottles|
|-|-|-|-|
|En flaska|Flaskor|Flaskan|Flaskorna|

|A dog|Dogs|The dog|The dogs|
|-|-|-|-|
|En hund|Hundar|Hunden|Hundarna|

|A thing|Things|The thing|The things|
|-|-|-|-|
|En sak|Saker|Saken|Sakerna|

|A heart|Hearts|The heart|The hearts|
|-|-|-|-|
|Ett hjärta|Hjärtan|Hjärtat|Hjärtana|

|A tree|Trees|The tree|The trees|
|-|-|-|-|
|Ett träd|Träd|Trädet|Träden|

## Pronouns

De = They

Dom = Them (but we barely use 'de', so you can always use 'dom')

Also swedish people don't give a fuck about objects in a sentence sometimes, so you don't need to say 'honom, henne', you can use 'han, hon'

Translation of 'He likes her'

'Han gillar hon'   (technically wrong, but sounds/looks perfectly fine)

'Han gillar henne' (right, but is one sullaby extra, and time is money)

## Greetings / Good byes

|Type | Variants|
|-|-|
|Hello|Hej, Tja (scha), Tjena (schena), Tjo (scho)|
|Good morning|God morgon, Morgon, Morrn, Mors (Mosch)|
|Good night|God natt, Gonatt|
|See ya|Vi ses, Ses, Vi hörs (technically we'll hear from one another), Hörs|
|Take care|Ha det bra, Ha det, Ha're|

## Demonstrative pronouns

All "det"'s here are often pronounced "de"

|English|Swedish|
|-|-|
|This|Det här|
|That|Det där|
|These|Dom här|
|Those|Dom där|

## Pronounciation

### Dialectal

Choosing between Å or O for the following words are dialectal.

I always use "Å", but people from the west coast (Göteborg, Borås) use "O" (for example Peter).

|Word|Pronounciation|
|-|-|
|Att|Å\/O|
|Och    | Å\/O|

### Real (this is not dialectal, it's the language)

|Word|Pronounciation|
|-|-|
|De		| Dom (you can use both, but often "dom is always used when it is a pronoun")|
|Sig		| Sej|
|Dig		| Dej|
|Mig		| Mej|
|...rs...		| ...ش... (this can also occur between words if a word ends with "r" and the next begins with "s", more on this in sentences)|
|Anders		| Andeش|
|Sj...|خ (it's a [sj-sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sj-sound), it's a softer خ)|
|Sjunga|خunga (sing)|
|Skj...|خ (same as above)|
|Skjuta|خuta (shoot)|
|Sk...|خ (same as above, but only sometimes)|
|Skit|خit (shit)|
|Ska|Ska (shall/will)|
|Tj|Sch ش|
|Tja|شa (hello)|

Other sj-sounds comes from:

* vi**si**onär
* **stj**ärna
* informa**ti**on

### Sentences

Oftentimes we completely slaughter the sentence when speaking it.

|Swedish|Spoken Swedish|English|
|-|-|-|
|Det är bara att göra det|De ba\'å görat|You just need to do it|
|Det tycker jag inte|De tycke\'ja\'nte|Nah, I don't think so|
|Han gör så|Han göشå|He does that|
|Han gillar inte det|Han gilla'nte de|He does not like that|

## Very important Swedish vocal ticks (which makes you sound native):

### Ju

When you disagree with someone / express doubt

> Person A: Himlen är röd! (the sky is red)
> 
> Person B: Nej, den är ju blå!! (no, it's **blue** (emphasis on that you disagree with him))

### Oj

Oops / My bad / (Your bad maybe?)

### Jo

Disagree with a negative statement.

> Person A: Den där bilen är inte din (that car isn't yours)
> 
> Person B: Jo! (yes it is)

There are multiple meanings of this word depending on how you emphasize it, which is best explained [here](https://twitter.com/sayitinswe/status/1328725225618497536?lang=en). (this is completely true).

### Nja

Eehh, maybe

Ex. Nja det tycker jag inte (eeh, I don't think so)

### Asså (derived from alltså)

Eng. "like" (like, you know)

Arabic. "yani"

Ex. Asså jag vet inte (Like, I don't know)

### Liksom

Similar to "asså" and can be used synonymously, but is a bit more difficult to say.

## Non translatable words

### Jobbigt (adjective)

An adjective derived from "jobb" (work). This means something is not exhausting, but you preferably don't want to do it because it brings you discomfort.

Ex. Nej fyfan vad jobbigt att behöva ta bussen. (Goddamn it's _relatively exhausting / would like to avoid_ to have to take the bus)

### Lagom

Not to much, to too little. If "luke warm" was generic for other items as well.

Ex. lagom varmt (luke warm)
