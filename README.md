# Swedish

## Pronouns

De = They

Dom = Them (but we barely use 'de', so you can always use 'dom')

Also swedish people don't give a fuck about objects in a sentence sometimes, so you don't need to say 'honom, henne', you can use 'han, hon'

Translation of 'He likes her'
'Han gillar hon'   (technically wrong, but sounds/looks perfectly find)
'Han gillar henne' (right, but is one sullaby extra, and time is money)

## Pronounciation

|Word|Pronounciation|

|De		| Dom|

|Dig		| Dej|
|Mig		| Mej|
|Och    | Å\/O|

### Sentences

Oftentimes we completely slaughter the sentence when speaking it.

|Swedish|Spoken Swedish|English|
|-|-|-|
|Det är bara att göra det|De ba\'å görat|You just need to do it|
|Det tycker jag inte|De tycke\'ja\'nte|Nah, I don't think so|

## Very important Swedish vocal ticks (which makes you sound native):

### Ju

When you disagree with someone / express doubt

> Person A: Himlen är röd! (the sky is red)
> 
> Person B: Nej, den är ju blå!! (no, it's **blue** (emphasis on that you disagree with him))

### Oj

Oops / My bad / (Your bad maybe?)

### Jo

Disagree with a negative statement.

> Person A: Den där bilen är inte din (that car isn't yours)
> 
> Person B: Jo! (yes it is)

There are multiple meanings of this word depending on how you emphasize it, which is best explained [here](https://twitter.com/sayitinswe/status/1328725225618497536?lang=en). (this is completely true).

### Nja

Eehh, maybe

Ex. Nja det tycker jag inte (eeh, I don't think so)

### Asså

Eng. "like" (like, you know)

Arabic. "yani"

Ex. Asså jag vet inte (Like, I don't know)

### Liksom

Similar to "asså" and can be used synonymously, but is a bit more difficult to say.

## Non translatable words

### Jobbigt (adjective)

An adjective derived from "jobb" (work). This means something is not exhausting, but you preferably don't want to do it because it brings you discomfort.

Ex. Nej fyfan vad jobbigt att behöva ta bussen. (Goddamn it's _relatively exhausting / would like to avoid_ to have to take the bus)

### Lagom

Not to much, to too little. If "luke warm" was generic for other items as well.

Ex. lagom varmt (luke warm)
